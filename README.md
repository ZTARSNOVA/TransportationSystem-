# 🚛 Transportation Company

You are developing a system for a transportation company that manages different types of vehicles: trucks and vans. Each type of vehicle has specific characteristics, such as its load capacity, yet they all share some common properties, like the model and the rental price per day. Additionally, the company needs to store information about rentals in a list of objects in memory. Each rental will include information about the vehicle, the rental duration, and the total cost. The system must be capable of calculating the total rental cost, taking into account possible discounts and the characteristics of the vehicles.
